          <b>HTML</b> is used to aid in the publication of web pages by providing
          a structure that defines elements like tables, forms, lists and headings, and identifies where
          different portions of our content begin and end. It can be used to embed other file formats
          like videos, audio files, documents like PDFs and spreadsheets, among others. HTML is
          the most relied upon language in the creation of web sites. In this text we will focus on
          HTML5. While it is technically still in draft form, many proposed elements are already
          supported by the newer versions of most of the popular browsers.

          <p><b>CSS</b> is a collection of styles that allows you to enhance the appearance f HTML elements on web pages.
          It can be used to define a set of formatting options that can be used to format text and other HTML elements.
          It defines a set of standard rules that provides a better control over the page layout and the appearance.
          CSS can be applied to specific HTML elements on a web page, to all the elements on the web page, or across
          all the web pages of the website.
          The selector is a good place to start with CSS. It is used to identify which item(s) the rule(s)
          following it will apply to, and is the first element of a rule definition. A selector can refer to
          an existing tag that is part of the HTML structure like unordered lists, paragraphs, inputs,
          or it can refer to a custom class, elementâ€™s name, or ID that we create.

<b>Javascript</b> is a client-side script, meaning the browser processes the code instead of the
web server. Client-side scripts are commonly used when we want to validate data before
sending it to the web server, adjusting the interfacein response to user feedback, and for
implementing other advanced features. </p>
<p>
Since JavaScript is part of the browser, it can be run without a web server present.
If the computer is slow or busy, the performance of our code may be reduced. If
JavaScript is disabled (less of a concern today than just a few years ago) then our
script will not run. This being said, this is less of an issue now, and JavaScript
can reduce the number of communications to a server, reducing transmission time and
improving performance.
